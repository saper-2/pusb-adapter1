This is v.1.1 stand for Fujitsu 7" LCD Display KD02902-6132 

- Print with support from bed.
- 4 walls, infill 50%

I used PET-G because I had loaded already, but PLA, ABS, other materials will work fine too.


Changelog:
- v1.0 - initial version
- v1.1 - longer front legs, a bit longer central hole so display is about 8-10mm higher, decreased central diameter so lcd will sit more stable (won't be rotating itself).
